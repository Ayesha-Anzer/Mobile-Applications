Wasting food is a common problem in our society. Food waste management is crucial since it can improve our environmental and economic sustainability. We have identified the use of mobile technology to reduce food waste management and built an android mobile application that allows restaurants to donate and share their foods and leftovers with people in need. This app will enable users to register, login, view items, add items, add items to cart, remove an item from the cart, and log out. This app is using the firebase storage and real-time database. Any user in need can see all the food images donated by different users and add it to his or her cart.
